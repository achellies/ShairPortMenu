ShairPortMenu v0.1
==================
Robert Carlsen | robertcarlsen.net

Description
-----------
A simple OS X status bar menu wrapper for ShairPort / HairTunes

ShairPort is an open source AirPort Express emulator.
Read more about ShairPort / HairTunes at the github site:
[https://github.com/albertz/shairport](https://github.com/albertz/shairport)

shairport.pl and hairtunes are included in this repo, however you may have to prepare your system to use them. Read the installation instructions at the above link. This version of hairtunes was compiled with OS X 10.6.7 on an Intel x86_64 processor. YMMV.

Building
--------
The Xcode project is pretty straightforward. Try to build and run and see what happens. Most of my cocoa experience is in iOS dev, so please forgive any glaring desktop cocoa snafus (though, kindly point out my folly so I can learn).

You should probably ensure that shairport.pl runs correctly on your system when launched standalone before troubleshooting issues with this menu widget.

Cheers!
